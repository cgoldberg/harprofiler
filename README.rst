About
-----

`harprofiler` is a python utility used for profiling web pageloads.  It loads web pages and saves JSON files in HAR (HTTP Archive) format.  By default, it will load a page once uncached, and then again with it cached in the browser.  A HAR file for each pageload is saved locally, and optionally uploaded to a HARStorage server instance. HAR files contain a log of HTTP client/server conversation and can be used for analysis of page load performance.
